## HW - Demo Video

- A 60 to 120 second narrated demo of the completed project is required
- Submission:
  - you may post it to YouTube - if so put the URL in the dropbox comments field
  - if you decide to upload a video file instead, it MUST be in the MP4 format
- The easiest way to record this demo is to use Zoom to capture your desktop - here is a 2-minute video on how to do this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D617OXKhSYw
  - another popular option for creating videos is [OBS](https://obsproject.com/download)
  - don't forget to "Share Screen" so that I can see you interacting with the project
  - don't forget to record the audio of your narration too, and consider using a better microphone than the one that came with your laptop `:-)`
- Please don't stress out over this requirement - I am the only one who will see the video - I won't be sharing or posting these
