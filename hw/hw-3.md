# HW-3 - Web App refactor (DRAFT)

## Overview
- For this HW you will choose a web app you previously created in IGME-235 or IGME-330 and will update and refactor the code


## I. Choose a web app to refactor
- There are two "pre-approved" web apps you may 

--- 

## II. Refactor the app's HTML
- The app's HTML file shall be named **index.html**
- Make sure that the HTML inside **index.html** follows our course naming standards ("kebab-case" for `id` and `class` names, etc)
- The HTML must pass the validator at: https://validator.w3.org/
- All files (.html, .js, .css etc) must follow course naming standards (kebab-case, no spaces etc)

---

## III. Refactor the JS
- all regular functions (including anonymous functions) will be refactored to utilize `const` and arrow function syntax
- variable and function names must follow course naming standards
- all code will be located in ES6 module files that use `import` and/or `export` as we have been doing all semester
  - if needed, refactor the code to "separate concern" into specific logical modules (meaning, separate .js files that utilize `export`
  - ES6 `class` declarations must be in their own distinct file (ex. **CircleSprite.js** or **RectangleSprite.js** etc...)

  
---

## IV. Refactor the CSS with Bulma
- use [PE-08 - Bulma I - Intro to Bulma](../pe/pe-08.md) as a "starter" page
- reimplement the app UI in the starter page
- use appropriate Bulma classes (for buttons etc)
- ...

---

## V. Add an about.html page


## VI. Choose a language to code in (15%)

- Option #1 - ES6 "Vanilla" JavaScript (max grade for this section is 0%)
- Option #2 - TypeScript (max grade for this section is 15%)
- Option #3 - React (max grade for this section is 15%)

---

## VII. Bundle the code
