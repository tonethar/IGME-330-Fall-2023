# IIFE & Module Practice (looking at JS scope)


## I. Instructions
- This is for practice, not for a grade
- Copy the code below and open it in a web browser to be sure it works
  - Pop in a breakpoint at the bottom of `init()` - you should see that we have 7 functions and 1 variable in what Chrome calls "script scope" - which is basically a *global* scope where things declared with `let` and `const` show up
  - Putting all your variables and functions in the global scope works fine for simple apps, but becomes potentially problematic with larger apps
  - For example you will see that **HW-2 Audio Visualizer** will end up having a large amount of JS code, and being able to break it into discrete modules with well-defined functionality and interfaces will make it a lot easier to debug while you are implementing it

## I-A. ES6 Modules
- Go ahead and convert the app over to ES6 module syntax
- Come up with a **utils.js** module that contains the single "pure" function with no dependencies, and the `quotes` array
- Then import those functions into a **main.js**
- Don't forget to write a `<script>` tag of `type="module"` that points at **main.js**
- And get rid of any code you don't need anymore
- One interesting decision: the code in **main.js** depends on the length of the `quotes` array - how will you handlle that?

<hr>

## I-B. Sounds "Iffy" to me
- Make a new copy of **quote-app.html** below and name it **quote-app-IIFE.html**
- Get ALL of the variables and functions out of "script scope" by wrapping everything in a single anonymous function
- Remember the [IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE)? - "Immediately Invoked Function Expression"
- Go ahead and wrap everything in an anonymous function
  - get rid of any code you don't need anymore
  - invoke the function
  - put in a breakpoint at the bottom of the IIFE and check the debugger - no more "script scope" variables at all!
  - put a breakpoint in `nextQuote()` and click the "Next Quote" button - you can see the [Closure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) variables and functions in the debugger

```js
(() => {
    //... put the code here ...
})();
```

- And if you really want to get crazy - you could *minify* the code:
  - https://www.toptal.com/developers/javascript-minifier
  - which is what JS bundling tools do - which we'll see later on in the semester when we work with Node.js and Webpack
