## VI. Demos

- #1 - To get the ***smoothest canvas animations***, and to account for the differing frame rates that [`window.requestAnimationFrame`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) gives you depending on the machine (and monitor) your JS is running on, it's best to calculate a "delta time" to use when drawing animations, and to also consider pausing/unpausing your animations (esp. for a game) when the window goes out of focus:
  - see demos here: https://people.rit.edu/~acjvks/shared/330/canvas/smooth-animation/
  - and also they are zipped up in myCourses
- #2 - ***DatGUI - Minimalist UI***
    - working link is here --> http://igm.rit.edu/~acjvks/courses/shared/330/demos/datGUI-demo/
    - files are in myCourses
- #3 - [Canvas - Drawing images & Blending Modes](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/canvas-5.md)
    - Also see ***kaleidoscope-demo*** - files are in myCourses
- #4 - ***Perlin Noise Demo*** - files are in myCourses
- #5 - ***Sprite Sheet Demo*** (featuring Mario) - files are in myCourses
