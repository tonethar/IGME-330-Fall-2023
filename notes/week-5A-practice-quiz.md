# Week 5A - Practice Quiz

## Instructions
- This is for practice, not for a grade

---

## I. Review questions from Canvas-1

1 - List the 3 drawing state properties we used in this demo

```


```

2 - List the 2 drawing state methods we used in this demo

```


```

3 - Give 4 different ways to represent the color green as a color in the canvas API

```js
// CSS keyword, Longhand hex, shorthand hex, RGB value, RGBa value, RGB percentage




```

4 - Write the one line of code that will change the current fill color to green

```


```

5 - Write the one line of code that will fill a 100x100 rectangle at x=200, y=50

```js
// we did it with a convenience method




```

## II. Canvas-1 - "Other review questions we'll go over in class"
1 - True or False. The canvas API was invented by Apple Computer (aka Apple Inc.)

2 - True or False. The canvas API is *hardware accelerated* on most modern browsers

3 - True or False. Canvas is a *vector-based* graphics system

4 - True or False. Canvas comes with a built-in scene graph and display list

5 - True or False. *raster-based* graphics systems represent graphics as a rectangular grid of pixels

## III. Canvas-2 - More review questions

- For the following questions, you can assume that a `ctx` variable exists and that is pointing at a `CanvasRenderingContext2D` instance

1 - In order for the user to actually see a canvas *path* you will need to ________________ and/or ________________ it.

```


```

2 - What are the default values for `ctx.strokeStyle`, `ctx.fillStyle` and `ctx.lineWidth` if your code does not otherwise specify them?

```


```

3 - What is the default `height` and `width` of the `<canvas>` tag if you donâ€™t specify a value (use google or the Web Inspector to find out)

```


```

4 - In the canvas coordinate system, where is `(0,0)` located?


```


```

5 - List 3 rectangle convenience methods (ones where you don't have to separately specify a *path*)


```


```

6 - Where is the default "anchor point" of a *rectangle* draw in canvas (center of rectangle, or upper-left, etc)

```


```

7 - Write code (without resorting to a canvas *convenience method*) that will *fill* a green 100x100 rectangle located at x=200, y=50

```



```

8 - Write code that will put a red 10-pixel *stroke* around a circle (of 50-pixel radius) that is located at `(320,240)`

```




```

9 - Where is the default "anchor point" of a *circle* draw in canvas (center, or upper-left, etc)

```


```

10 - Are `arc()` angle values specified in *degrees* or *radians*?

```


```

11 - By default, which way is the `arc()` drawn, *clockwise* or *counter-clockwise*?

```


```

12 - Write code that will draw a 5-pixel wide purple line from `(100,100)` to `(640,480)`

```


```

13 - A path "ends" when you call `closePath()` or ________________

```


```
