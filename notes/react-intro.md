# Into to React

## I. Overview

## III. React in the browser
- React's JSX component syntax will not run in the browser directly, and first needs to be transpiled into VanillaJS.
- The simplest way to do this (which is appropriate for development, not production) is to let the browser do the transpiling for us by importing React and Babel libraries from a CDN
- React:
  - https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html
  - 
- Babel - `babel-standalone` - a build of Babel for use in non-Node.js environments:
  - https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-standalone
  - https://cdnjs.com/libraries/babel-standalone
