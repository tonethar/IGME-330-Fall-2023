# Week 1A

## I. Course Description

**Official description from SIS**
*This course provides students the opportunity to explore the design and development of media-rich web applications that utilize both static and procedurally manipulated media such as text, images and audio. This course examines client and server-side web development and features common to such applications. Issues explored include framework characteristics, information management, presentation, interactivity, persistence, and data binding. Programming projects are required.*

## III. 330's Technology "Stack"

- Web technology "stacks" consist of
  - a "front end" client application that the user interacts with - in this course we will create HTML/CSS/JS front ends
  - a "back end" application that contains a database & the business logic of the application - in this course we'll be using a little PHP, as well as the Firebase  Realtime database to store data in the cloud
  - "full stack" refers to the entire application from the "front end" to the back end, as well as the code that connects the two parts
- The number and variety of development stacks being used right now is truly mind-numbing, and the list continually grows. Existing APIs are continually updated and old ones deprecated. Event the dominant frameworks like Angular and React are continually updated. Below are some current options being used in industry:
  - Front ends (a few examples):
    - could be built out of HTML/CSS/JS, or native iOS, native Android, Dart or Java
    - Popular front-end frameworks and tools - these often add a component model and data-binding to the underlying technologies - React, Angular, Vue, Flutter, ...
  - Back ends (a few examples):
    - **LAMP** - Linux/Apache/mySQL/PHP (and oldie, but still used)  - also WAMP, WIMP, MAMP, SAMP, FAMP, iAMP, LEMP, LYME, LYCE and so on 
    - Django (Python), Ruby on Rails (Ruby), Laravel (PHP application framework), ...
  - Full Stack (a few examples):
    - **MEAN** - MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node and **MERN** (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node) and **MEVN** (Vue.js instead of React)
  - Databases - mySQL, MongoDB, GraphQL, Redis, Casandra, Hbase, CouchDB, Firestorm, ...
  - Cloud Providers - AWS amplify, Supabase, Nhost, MongoDB, Realm, Appwrite, Parse, ...
  - Meta Frameworks - stitch multiple frameworks together - Next.js, Vite, SvelteKit, ...
  - ***Hopefully you get the idea - there are a gigantic number of technologies and combinations:***

- **Our "330 stack" is built on foundational web technologies that you need to know (no matter what frameworks your employer is using) and is relatively "stable"**:
  - HTML/CSS
  - Vanilla JS (i.e. no 3rd party frameworks such as React)
  - Web Components
  - A little PHP
  - Firebase Cloud Storage (Realtime Database)
  - Some TypeScript

- [schedule.md](../schedule.md)
  - note the exam dates
- [syllabus.md](../syllabus.md)
  - note the attendance policy
  - AND the late assignment policy + "Late Submission Dropbox" in myCourses

## V. JavaScript Review - JS in the console

- 1. What is JavaScript?
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
  - Used on both the client-side and server-side to create interactive web applications
  - Weakly typed:
    - after they are declared, variables can contain any type
    - JS uses *dynamic typing* to verify the type safety of a program at runtime, as opposed to compile time (static) typing
  - Multi-Paradigm:
    - *imperative* - a series of commands that describe how the program behaves (as opposed to *declarative* languages such as CSS or SQL)
    - *functional* - use functions to compose a program, avoid globals & mutable state
    - *event-driven* - program flow is driven by user and system events
    - *object-based* 
      - the *object literal* - letting us create objects directly, without having to `class` a class first
      - many built-in objects to use - ex. `String`, `Number`, `Array`, `Math`, `Date`, `Map`, `Set`, ...
      - both *prototypical* and *classical inheritance* when the developer creates their own objects
      - *duck typed* - an object's suitability to be used for particular purpose is determined by the presence of certain methods and properties, rather than the type of the object itself
- 2. JavaScript in the console - Review & Demo
  - the console is an interactive **REPL** - "Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop"
    - shift-enter for multi-line code
    - up arrow to repeat last typed line
  - declaring variables with `let` and `const`
  - operators
  - data types:
    - `Boolean`, `Number`, `String`, `Null`, `Undefined`, `Symbol` (new for ES6) and `BigInt` (really new)
    - and `Object`
    - Reference: 
      - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures
      - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects
  - `document.querySelector()` and `document.querySelectorAll()`
  - `console.log()`

<hr>

## VI. Greeter Demo - Starter Code

- Name the file **`<yourLastname>-<yourFirstInitial>-greeter.html`** 
  - ex. "Ace Coder" would name their file **coder-a-greeter.html**

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Greeter</title>
    <style>
      *{font-size:1.5em;}
    </style>
    <script>
    
    // 1 - get a reference to the button
    // 2 - add a click event to button that calls a `sayHello` function
    // 3 - create a `sayHello()` function
    // 3A - get name of person from the <input>
    // 3B - get a reference to the #output <p>
    // 3C - update HTML of #output <p>
    
    </script>
  </head>
<body>
  <button>Click Me!</button>
  <input id="input-firstname" placeholder="Type in your name">
  <p id="output">???</p>
</body>
</html>
```

- **Demo**
  - ["Sloppy Mode"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Sloppy_mode)
    - don't need to declare variables! If we forget to declare them they end up in the global scope!
    - duplicate parameter names allowed in functions!
  - ALWAYS `'use strict';` - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode
     - (but next week we'll learn about ES6 modules, which run in strict mode by default)
  - Why we don't use `var` to declare variables in this class
    - scoped to function (or global) rather that to a code block like most languages
    - can be referenced *BEFORE* they are declared - which can lead to code errors!
  - `let` and `const` use *block* scope and can only be referenced *AFTER* they are declared - which helps to catch coding errors early!
  - Functions
    - writing functions
    - calling functions
  - Selecting DOM Elements (DOM = Document Object Model)
    - Selecting DOM elements:
      - `document.querySelector()`
      - `document.querySelectorAll()`
    - Events:
      - DOM elements have to have been loaded by the browser before we can manipulate their properties
      - event handlers - the `onclick` attribute
      - OR `element.addEventListener("click", funcRef)`

<hr>

## VII. Debugging
- JavaScript Debugger:
  - setting breakpoints
  - inspecting variable values 
  - viewing the call stack
  - "View Page Source" v. the Debugger's "Inspect Elements" view

<hr>
  
## VIII. Today's Activities
  
- Follow along on today's demo
  - make sure the HTML file is named properly - **`<yourLastname>-<yourFirstInitial>-greeter.html`**
  - ex. "Ace Coder" would name their file **coder-a-greeter.html**
  - Get the following working:    
    - Add a "last name" input so that we can greet the person using both their first and last name
    - *Declaratively* (using CSS) make the button 50 pixels tall by 100 pixels wide, with a `font-size` of 14 points
    - *Imperatively* (using JavaScript) give the paragraph a red text color, and a yellow background color
  - ZIP and Post this prior to the end of class - even if it's not fully functional - as this is how we are taking attendance today
- Next time we will finish up the above demo, and [Practice Exercise 01](../pe/pe-01.md) will reinforce what we've covered here today
