# Week 1A

## I. Course Description

**Official description from SIS**
*This course provides students the opportunity to explore the design and development of media-rich web applications that utilize both static and procedurally manipulated media such as text, images and audio. This course examines client and server-side web development and features common to such applications. Issues explored include framework characteristics, information management, presentation, interactivity, persistence, and data binding. Programming projects are required.*

## III. Syllabus & Schedule
- (FYI: [Practice Exercise 01](../pe/pe-01.md) has been posted - see myCourses for due date)
- [schedule.md](../schedule.md)
  - note the exam dates
- [syllabus.md](../syllabus.md)
  - note the attendance policy
  - AND the late assignment policy + "Late Submission Dropbox" in myCourses
  - AND the Academic Integrity policy - *do your own work ...*
- Generative AI
  - In this course, we will be utilizing some of these tools to *research concepts*
  - NOT for generating code that is copy/pasted verbatim and without thought or understanding on the part of the user (meaning student OR prof)
  - [GPT example](../notes/gpt-3.5-example.md)

## IV. JavaScript Review - JS in the console

- 1. What is JavaScript?
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
  - Used on both the client-side and server-side to create interactive web applications
  - Weakly typed:
    - after they are declared, variables can contain any type
    - JS uses *dynamic typing* to verify the type safety of a program at runtime, as opposed to compile time (static) typing
  - Multi-Paradigm:
    - *imperative* - a series of commands that describe how the program behaves (as opposed to *declarative* languages such as CSS or SQL)
    - *functional* - use functions to compose a program, avoid globals & mutable state
    - *event-driven* - program flow is driven by user and system events
    - *object-based* 
      - the *object literal* - letting us create objects directly, without having to `class` a class first
      - many built-in objects to use - ex. `String`, `Number`, `Array`, `Math`, `Date`, `Map`, `Set`, ...
      - both *prototypical* and *classical inheritance* when the developer creates their own objects
      - *duck typed* - an object's suitability to be used for particular purpose is determined by the presence of certain methods and properties, rather than the type of the object itself
- 2. JavaScript in the console - Review & Demo
  - the console is an interactive **REPL** - "Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop"
    - shift-enter for multi-line code
    - up arrow to repeat last typed line
  - declaring variables with `let` and `const`
  - operators
  - data types:
    - `Boolean`, `Number`, `String`, `Null`, `Undefined`, `Symbol` (new for ES6) and `BigInt` (really new)
    - and `Object`
    - Reference: 
      - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures
      - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects
  - `document.querySelector()` and `document.querySelectorAll()`
  - `console.log()`

<hr>

## V. Greeter Demo - Starter Code

- Name the file **`<yourLastname>-<yourFirstInitial>-greeter.html`** 
  - ex. "Ace Coder" would name their file **coder-a-greeter.html**

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Greeter</title>
    <style>
      *{font-size:1.5em;}
    </style>
    <script>
    
    // 1 - get a reference to the button
    // 2 - add a click event to button that calls a `sayHello` function
    // 3 - create a `sayHello()` function
    // 3A - get name of person from the <input>
    // 3B - get a reference to the #output <p>
    // 3C - update HTML of #output <p>
    
    </script>
  </head>
<body>
  <button>Click Me!</button>
  <input id="input-firstname" placeholder="Type in your name">
  <p id="output">???</p>
</body>
</html>
```

- **Demo**
  - ["Sloppy Mode"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Sloppy_mode)
    - don't need to declare variables! If we forget to declare them they end up in the global scope!
    - duplicate parameter names allowed in functions!
  - ALWAYS `'use strict';` - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode
     - (but next week we'll learn about ES6 modules, which run in strict mode by default)
  - Why we don't use `var` to declare variables in this class
    - scoped to function (or global) rather that to a code block like most languages
    - can be referenced *BEFORE* they are declared - which can lead to code errors!
  - `let` and `const` use *block* scope and can only be referenced *AFTER* they are declared - which helps to catch coding errors early!
  - Functions
    - writing functions
    - calling functions
    - are [*first class* data types](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-the-first-class-function-in-javascript/) in JS
    - can end up in global scope, but it depends on where/how they are declared
    - can be called "before" they are declared (if declared with the `function` keyword)
  - Selecting DOM Elements (DOM = Document Object Model)
    - Selecting DOM elements:
      - `document.querySelector()`
      - `document.querySelectorAll()`
    - Events:
      - DOM elements have to have been loaded by the browser before we can manipulate their properties
      - event handlers - the `onclick` attribute
      - OR `element.addEventListener("click", funcRef)`

## VI. Debugging
- JavaScript Debugger:
  - setting breakpoints
  - inspecting variable values 
  - viewing the call stack
  - "View Page Source" v. the Debugger's "Inspect Elements" view

<hr>
  
## VII. Today's Activities
  
- Follow along on today's demo
  - make sure the HTML file is named properly - **`<yourLastname>-<yourFirstInitial>-greeter.html`**
  - ex. "Ace Coder" would name their file **coder-a-greeter.html**
  - Get the following working:    
    - Add a "last name" input so that we can greet the person using both their first and last name
    - *Declaratively* (using CSS) make the button 50 pixels tall by 100 pixels wide, with a `font-size` of 14 points
    - *Imperatively* (using JavaScript) give the paragraph a red text color, and a yellow background color
  - ZIP and Post this prior to the end of class - even if it's not fully functional - as this is how we are taking attendance today
- Next time we will finish up the above demo, and [Practice Exercise 01](../pe/pe-01.md) will reinforce what we've covered here today
