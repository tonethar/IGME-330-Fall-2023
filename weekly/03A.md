<hr>

## II. Previous Assignments
- [PE-02 - More Greeter](../pe/pe-02.md)
  - Questions?
- [PE-03 - Review `XHR` & Parsing Text/CSV/XML](../pe/pe-03.md) - will review when we cover JSON, below
- [2B Checkoff - adding ES6 moduels to **DoubleIt**](./02B.md#vi-2b-checkoff)
  - [ES6 Module Notes](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/ES6-module-pattern-2225.md)
  - [export](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export) and [import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)
  - Here is another nice reference with examples- https://javascript.info/import-export
  - Note that you can export a symbol (function, class, or variable) right when you declare it - example:
    - `export const doubleIt = num => num * 2;`
  - OR at the botton of the file like this:
    - `export { doubleIt };`
  - Let's look at `default` exports/imports - which are used when you are only exporting a single symbol from a file, such as a `class` definition
  - Let's also look at "name-spaced" imports, which are useful when you are importing a lot of functions and want to make it clear what file they came from. Example:
    - `import * as utils from "./utils.js"`
  - Something to keep in mind, ES6 modules (similar to classes and OOP practices) are "for people/programmers" - and NOT for the computer
    - the computer doesn't care if all of your code is jammed in one file and the varialbes and functions are named nonsensically - no matter how your code is structured computers only see 1's and zeroes
    - code organization, modules, OOP etc are there solely to help developers write better code with fewer b ugs, and to more easily maintain/update it
