# Week 12A

## I. HW-3 Reminders

- [HW-3 - *Web App refactor*](../hw/hw-3.md)
  - [HW3 - Bulma Requirements](../hw/hw3-bulma-requirements.md)
  - [Converting an existing project to TypeScript](../hw/hw3-typescript-notes.md)
- ***Checkoff: HW-3 Checkpoint*** (due Wednesday night) - here are the dropbox instructions:

```
ZIP & POST here:
- 1 - The current state of your HW-3 in your ***lastName*-*firstInitial*-hw3-refactor** folder
 (we started this in class Thursday 11/9)
- 2 - A zipped up version of the original project you are refactoring:
  - this is not necessary if you are refactoring 330's HW-2
  
In the comments field of this dropbox
- 1 - State which project you are refactoring:
  - recall that only two projects are "pre-approved"
    - IGME-330's *HW-2 - Audio Visualizer* - Ultimate Version
    - IGME-235's *Project 2 - Web Service Application*
  - if you are refactoring a different project, recall that you should have already DM'd me in Slack for permission/documentation
```
