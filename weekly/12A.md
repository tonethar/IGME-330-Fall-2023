 (we started this in class Thursday 11/9)
- 2 - A zipped up version of the original project you are refactoring:
  - this is not necessary if you are refactoring 330's HW-2
  
In the comments field of this dropbox
- 1 - State which project you are refactoring:
  - recall that only two projects are "pre-approved"
    - IGME-330's *HW-2 - Audio Visualizer* - Ultimate Version
