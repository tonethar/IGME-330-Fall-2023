# Week 9B

## I. Coming up - Exam #2

- Is scheduled for week 11A (Tuesday 11/7)
- Same format as last time
- We will talk about it next week

---

## II. Review 6B Take-home quiz *(remember that one?)*
  - PDF is in myCourses
  - Concepts:
    - *reference* types v. *value* types
    - adding properties (or misspelling existing properties) to existing objects (both literals and "class made")
    - calling non-existent methods on objects
    - what `Object.seal()` does to objects & arrays
    - what `Object.freeze()` does to objects & arrays
    - how about if a property (or array element) *points* at a reference type?
  - Resources that will help:
    - https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Fall-2023/blob/main/notes/object-notes.md
    - https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Fall-2023/blob/main/notes/es6-class-notes.md
    - Immutability with `const`: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const
    - JS value v. Reference types: https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-primitive-vs-reference-values/
    - Every value in JS can be *treated* like an object:
      - Note that we DID NOT say that ~"Every value in JavaScript IS an object"~ <-- this statement is NOT true

## III. Review `node` & `npm` workflow
- Can I use VSCode? You betcha!
  - but we don't need to use *Live Server*!
- Let's make a simple `express` app - https://www.npmjs.com/package/express
  - name your project folder **express-app**
  - reminder: be sure to verify that **express-app** is your *current working directory*
  - when you are done, use **ctrl-c** to quit your `express` server

---


## IV. Transpiling Code with Webpack & Babel
- [Bundling & Transpiling JS](../notes/bundling-transpiling.md)
- We'll also *lint* our ES6 code before we transpile/bundle it:
  - https://eslint.org/play
  - add rules for `quotes`, `max-len`, `eol-last`, `arrow-parens` and `prefer-const`

---

## V. Preview - TypeScript (we will cover this next time!)
- [Intro to TypeScript](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/intro-typescript.md)
