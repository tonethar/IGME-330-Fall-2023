# Week 9B

## I. Review `node` & `npm` workflow
- Can I use VSCode? You betcha!
  - but we don't need to use *Live Server*!
- Let's make a simple `express` app - https://www.npmjs.com/package/express
  - name your project folder **express-app**
  - reminder: be sure to verify that **express-app** is your *current working directory*
  - when you are done, use **ctrl-c** to quit your `express` server

## II. Transpiling Code with Webpack & Babel
- [Bundling & Transpiling JS](../notes/bundling-transpiling.md)

## III. TypeScript (we will cover this next time!)
- [Intro to TypeScript](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/intro-typescript.md)
