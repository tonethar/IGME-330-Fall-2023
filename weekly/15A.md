# Week 15A - Finish up Firebase

---

## I. HW-4 Helper for *favorite-parks-viewer.html*
- [4 - More Firebase - creating a likes counter for Dog names](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/firebase-4.md)
- [5 - Firebase - deleting elements from the cloud](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/firebase-5.md)
  - not required for HW-4, but this is useful content

## II. HW-4 Helper? - Suggestion: create a *firebase.js* code module

- Below is a code snippet that some of you might find useful
- Because your Firebase code will need to be utilized by both your index.html** page (for example to WRITE the userâ€™s favorites to the cloud) and your **favorite-parks-viewer.html** page (to READ the "most liked by everyone" favorites from the cloud) - that Firebase code should probably be broken out into a separate JS code module named **firebase.js**
- Then the necessary Firebase functionality can then be imported into **main.js** and **parks-viewer-main.js** as needed - here is the code from the *Dog Finder* example:

**firebase.js**

```js
import { initializeApp } from "https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/LINK-TO-LATEST-VERSION-FIREBASE.js";
// https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries
import { getDatabase, ref, set, push, onValue, increment } from  "https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/LINK-TO-LATEST-VERSION-FIREBASE.js";

// Your web app's Firebase configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  // PUT YER CREDENTIALS HERE
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
console.log(app);
const db = getDatabase();

const likedDogsPath = "df-liked-dogs/";

const pushLikedDogToCloud = dog => {
  dog.likes = increment(1);
  const favRef = ref(db, `${likedDogsPath}${dog.hash}`);
  set(favRef, dog); // `dog` is an object with `.title`, `.url`, `.likes` properties etc
};

// You might get awway with exporting fewer functions than this
export { db, likedDogsPath, ref, set, push, pushLikedDogToCloud, onValue };
```
