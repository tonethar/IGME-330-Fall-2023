# Week 7B

## I. Review: Exam #1
- We will review the correct answers
- There is an HTML file to try out the code questions
  - in myCourses **exam-1-review-start.html.zip**
- You will be handing back your paper exam copy after we have finished reviewing it
- So be sure to take notes (not on the exam itself!) about the questions/concepts you missed!
- If you think there were points that were deducted incorrectly, then write "CHECK" in big letters on the first page of the exam
  - also note the section and question number that you want looked at
  - we will re-grade your exam in the next day or 2 and let you know

  - handing out a paper copy, PDF is in myCourses
  - covers objects & classes 
  - not collecting for a grade
  - we will review the answers next time

## IV. Sprites Review
- We did this last week on [6A](06A.md)
- [ES6 Class Notes](../notes/es6-class-notes.md)
- Things to look at:
  - Adding new objects to arrays
  - Looping over arrays:
    - `for`, `for..of`, `array.forEach()`
  - `CircleSprite` class constructor
    - use `Object.assign()` and shorthand object property initialization
    - object destructuring the parameter list & passing in a single object as a parameter
    - default parameter values
    - Using `Object.seal()` in the `CircleSprite` constructor

## V. Canvas Transformations

- [**Canvas 2D Essential Skills #8 - Canvas Transformations**](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/8-canvas-transformations.md)
  - Concepts:
    - Transformations: `ctx.translate()`, `ctx.rotate()`, `ctx.scale()`
    - Managing transformations with `ctx.save()` and `ctx.restore()`
  - Docs:
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Transformations
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/translate
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/rotate
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/scale
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/setTransform

## VI. Checkoff - Translate/Rotate/Scale

- ***Here are the instructions (see myCourses dropbox for due date):***

1) Follow along with the demo we do in class on 7B - https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/8-canvas-transformations.md - and build what we built.

2) If you miss anything - no problem! The video links at the bottom of the above page walk though the entire demo.

3) Once you have re-created what we made (if it's slightly different than ours, no biggie!), add the following:

    - draw an additional rotating triangle
    - draw that triangle with a triangle helper function - no we didn't make this function in the demo - you can do it - be sure to use the "good triangle" code that draws around 0,0
    - draw at least one more animated shape (square, triangle,circle, ...). For this, you must animate either scale or translation (or both, or add in rotation and do all 3!)

4) Tell us what you did in the comments field of the dropbox

5) Name the file ***lastName-firstInitial*-trs.html**

6) ZIP and POST the file here
