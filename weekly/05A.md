## III. Previous Assignments
- Review: [PE-05 - Canvas Screensaver](../pe/pe-05.md)
  - covered most of the above, plus ...
  - helper functions written for you - `getRandomColor()` and `getRandomInt(min, max)` 
  - writing your own helper functions:
    - `drawRectangle(ctx,x,y,width,height,fillStyle="black",lineWidth=0,strokeStyle="black")`
    - `drawArc(ctx,x,y,radius,fillStyle="black",lineWidth=0,strokeStyle="black", startAngle=0,endAngle=Math.PI * 2)`
    - `drawLine(ctx,x1,y1,x2,y2,lineWidth=1,strokeStyle="black")`
  - our helper functions utilized the  ["drawing state stack"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/save#the_drawing_state) and [`ctx.save()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/save) / [`ctx.restore()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/restore)
  - getting coordinates of mouse clicks with `canvasClicked()`
  - rectangles the hard way - `ctx.beginPath()`, [`ctx.rect()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/rect), `ctx.closePath()`
  - [`window.requestAnimationFrame`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame)
