# PE-04 - Review `XHR` & Parsing JSON

## I. Loading and parsing JSON files with `XHR`

- Follow the instructions here:
  - [Ajax-4 - loading and parsing JSON files](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-ajax-4.md)
  - Topics covered - quite a few - see the exercise & video linked above
- Make sure that your files are in a ***containing folder*** named  ***lastName-firstInitial*-pe-4**
- **IMPORTANT NOTE:** When working on [HW-1](../hw/hw-1.md), structure your JSON data file (which just contains "babble") to be a simple as possible - it just needs to contain the 3 arrays of babble - so it can look very similar to the [**simple-pet-names.json**](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-ajax-4.md#ii-start-files) file in [Ajax-4 - loading and parsing JSON files](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-ajax-4.md)
